# endless-scroll-stop
Stop scrolling mindlessly and go to bed!

Sometimes we just can't stop scrolling on our social media feeds. This means we end up reading mostly garbage when we could be doing something much more productive. 
Like going to bed. 

The endless-scroll-stop extension reminds you when you've scrolled too much and tells you to go to sleep. If you ignore it, it'll just remind you again later.


## How to Use
1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Go to Chrome > Customize (the three dots) > More Tools > Extensions
3. Click on Load unpacked and select your repo directory
4. Get some sleep!


## Other
1. You'll need to reload any open tabs for this to work on those tabs.
2. The source is super-simple, so tweak it as you will.
3. Seriously, stop scrolling and go to bed!
